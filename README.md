## U.S. Chronic Disease Mortality Trend Map
Authors: Group 415 - Ziqian Liao, Joanna Shen

We will be utilizing a publicly available dataset of the U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators (CDI), sourced from the Division of Population Health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [1]. This comprehensive dataset includes chronic disease data pertaining to key areas of public health practice as reported by U.S. states and territories via the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). The dataset consists of an extensive array of time-labeled chronic disease prevalence statistics and data on relevant risk factors.
