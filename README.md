#### Data Source
For this visualization project, we used a publicly available dataset from the CDC on U.S. Chronic Disease Indicators to understand the population affected by chronic diseases and associated risk/preventative factors. It covers data from 2010 to 2021 for U.S. states and includes information on the prevalence and mortality rates of diseases and relevant statistics on risk factor topics like alcohol use, obesity, pre-pregnancy exposures, and so on. We focused on 9 diseases and 4 risk/preventative factors for this specific visualization project.
